# Contributing to flare_flutter_sdk
 
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the first native Flutter/Dart
SDK for the Flare Network. This document defines the standards and workflow
for all contributions.

## 1. Development Setup
 
**Requirements:**
 
- Flutter SDK >= 3.0.0
- Dart SDK >= 3.0.0
- Windows + PowerShell (primary dev environment)
**Clone and setup:**
 
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/nemorixgroup/flare-flutter-sdk.git
cd flare-flutter-sdk
git checkout develop
flutter pub get
```
 
**Verify setup:**
 
```powershell
.\scripts\pre_commit.ps1
```
 
All checks must pass green before your first change.

## 2. Branch Strategy
 
main          <- stable releases only (tagged)
develop       <- integration branch for all features
feature/*     <- one branch per feature or fix
 
**Branch naming:**
 
Examples:
feature/crypto-secp256k1
feature/ftso-feed-client
feature/fassets-mint-flow
fix/fdc-verifier-timeout
docs/readme-quick-start
 
**Rules:**
 
- Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`
- Every feature branch is created from `develop`
- Merges to `develop` via Pull Request only
- Merges to `main` via Pull Request from `develop` at release time
---
 
## 3. Commit Conventions
 
This project uses **Conventional Commits**.
Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
 
| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behavior change |
| `chore` | Build, deps, CI, tooling |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
 
**Scope examples:**
 
feat(crypto): add secp256k1 key generation
feat(ftso): implement feed ID helper and FtsoV2 client
feat(fassets): implement FXRP mint flow
fix(fdc): handle verifier timeout with retry
test(network): add NetworkConfig URL tests
docs(readme): add quick start example
chore(ci): add coverage threshold check
 
**Rules:**
 
- Description in lowercase, no period at end
- One logical change per commit
- If a commit closes an issue: add `Closes #42` in the body
---
 
## 4. Code Standards
 
**Linter:** `very_good_analysis`, zero warnings, zero infos.
 
**Section comments:** Use `// ---- Section Name ----` for logical grouping:
```dart
// ---- Constructor ----
 
// ---- Fields ----
 
// ---- Public Methods ----
 
// ---- Private Methods ----
```
 
**Documentation:** Every public API element must have a dartdoc comment:
```dart
/// Reads a single FTSO feed by its encoded feed ID.
///
/// Throws [FlareException] if the RPC call fails or the feed ID is unknown.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final feed = await client.ftso.getFeedById(
///   FeedId.fromName(category: FeedCategory.crypto, name: 'FLR/USD'),
/// );
/// ```
Future<FtsoFeed> getFeedById(FeedId feedId) async { ... }
```
 
**No hardcoded secrets:** Private keys, mnemonics, and API keys must never
appear in source code, tests, or logs.
 
**No `print()` statements:** Use proper error propagation via exceptions.
 
---
 
## 5. Testing Standards
 
**Coverage target:** >= 80% line and branch coverage across all modules
(see the grant milestone targets in the project's Technical Description).
 
**Test file location:** Mirror the `lib/src/` structure under `test/src/`:
 
lib/src/ftso/ftso_client.dart
test/src/ftso/ftso_client_test.dart
 
**Test structure:**
 
```dart
void main() {
  // ---- GroupName ----
 
  group('ClassName', () {
    setUp(() { ... });
 
    test('does something specific', () {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });
 
    test('throws FlareException when ...', () {
      expect(
        () => someCall(),
        throwsA(isA<FlareException>()),
      );
    });
  });
}
```
 
**Every feature must include:**
 
- Happy path test
- Error path tests (invalid input, network failure, edge cases)
- Security test: private keys must not appear in exception messages
---
 
## 6. Pre-Commit Gate
 
Run before **every** commit:
```powershell
.\scripts\pre_commit.ps1
```
 
This runs in order:
1. `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .`
2. `dart analyze --fatal-infos`
3. `flutter test`
**The gate must pass green before any `git commit`.** No exceptions.
 
---
 
## 7. Pull Request Process
 
1. Create your feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes with passing pre-commit
3. Open a PR targeting `develop`
4. Fill in the PR template completely
5. Wait for CI to pass (GitHub Actions)
6. Request review if needed
**PR title** must follow Conventional Commits format:
 
feat(ftso): implement feed ID helper and FtsoV2 client
 
---
 
## 8. Adding a New Feature
 
Example: adding `FtsoClient`:
 
```powershell
# 1. Create branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/ftso-feed-client
 
# 2. Create files
# lib/src/ftso/ftso_client.dart
# test/src/ftso/ftso_client_test.dart
 
# 3. Export from barrel file
# lib/flare_flutter_sdk.dart -> add export
 
# 4. Run pre-commit
.\scripts\pre_commit.ps1
 
# 5. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ftso): add FtsoClient skeleton with JSON-RPC base"
 
# 6. Push and open PR
git push origin feature/ftso-feed-client
```

## 9. Security Policy
 
**Reporting a vulnerability:**
 
- Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Email: flare@nemorixpay.com
- We will respond within 48 hours
- A patched version will be released within 7 days of confirmation
**Key handling rules:**
 
- `PrivateKey` and `Mnemonic` classes must override `toString()` to return
  a redacted string (e.g., `PrivateKey[REDACTED]`)
- No key material may appear in exception messages, stack traces, or logs
- Security tests are non-negotiable blockers for every milestone
